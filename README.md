## About

This is my personal Home Assistant configuration. My guiding princile is to have
full local control of all my devices. I intend everything to run Tasmota, 
ESPHome or speak Zigbee to my MQTT broker.

This project still an active work in progress. Stay tuned for more information about
what hardware I am using, how it's configured, etc.

For now, please enjoy, and feedback always welcome!
